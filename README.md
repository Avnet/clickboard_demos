## Overview
This repository contains example solutions for the MikroE Click Board software located at https://github.com/Avnet/clickmodules. Specific details for implementing the demo code is documented in the README.md files located in the various platform directories.  

There is also an article on Element14 at https://www.element14.com/community/blogs/JimFlynn/2019/07/12/using-mikroe-click-boards-with-microsoft-sphere that shows how the demonstration code is used in the projects listed  here.

## Common code usage
In all the demo programs, the code from https://github.com/Avnet/clickmodules is first compiled into a linkable library.  The specific demo code is then compiled and linked with the newly created library to produce an executable image.
